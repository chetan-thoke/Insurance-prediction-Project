📌 Insurance Cost Prediction
📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting insurance costs using machine learning techniques based on customer demographic and health-related features. The goal is to build a reliable regression model that can estimate insurance charges accurately and demonstrate an end-to-end data science workflow.

🎯 Problem Statement

Insurance companies need to estimate customer insurance costs efficiently. Using historical data, this project aims to predict insurance charges based on factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following features:

age – Age of the insured person
sex – Gender
bmi – Body Mass Index
children – Number of dependents
smoker – Smoking status
region – Residential area
charges – Insurance cost (target variable)
